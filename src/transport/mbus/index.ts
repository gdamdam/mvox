/**
 * mbus-client — tab-to-tab WebRTC audio for the m-suite.
 * AGPL-3.0-or-later. See docs/protocol.md for the wire protocol.
 *
 * Vendored verbatim from the sibling mbus project (mbus/packages/mbus-client,
 * AGPL-3.0-or-later, github.com/gdamdam/mbus) — index.ts, client.ts and
 * protocol.ts. The suite has no shared package registry yet (this library is
 * the seed of a future `mcore`), so it is copied here and credited rather than
 * imported. Kept
 * byte-for-byte with upstream so it stays trivially re-syncable; do not edit —
 * change it upstream and re-copy.
